# capstone-project-tattoo-shop-web-app
This is my Capstone Project for SAIT that I created for the business Good Friend Tattoo in Calgary.
They needed an inventory system, front end website where clients could see their work, an e-mail subscription list and a way for clients to e-mail them from the website.
The inventory system has a log-in page as well as all basic CRUD functionality for adding new inventory items into the system and also an administrative page where the administrator can add delete and edit.
new users and a page where users can edit all their basic information.
The application is built with Java jsp's, Java Servlets, css, javascript, MySQL, JPA, and Java Mail. 
The application uses an MVC architecture and uses MySQL for all database interactions.  I used JPA for database connections.
THe e-mailing uses Java-mail to send e-mails from the website to the three different tattoo artists at the shop.
